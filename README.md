# bitburner scripts - toolkit
*scripts for the game https://bitburner-official.github.io*

## open source
I have prepared my own scripts, but also derivated some scripts from the official examples provided by bitburner.
You can safely take a copy of my scripts and update them for your need, they are free of charges.

## how to start
Once you have reach the level where you own the Singularity API, you can use the script initialProgramLoad.js at each restart after augmentations installations. Before you own the API, you must procede manually with:
1. nuke joesguns
2. run scripts/discover-network.js

## scripts per level of usage
from beginners to high level users, the scripts are using some API which cannot work before you reach the level where you can gain the API.

WARNING! I have organized my scripts in a folder named 'scripts', all scripts refering external scripts are expecting to find scripts in this folder on each host.

### basic-hack.js
largely inspired by the official script, it's the script copied on all servers to gain money and hack experience.
This script will generate money by hacking a target server.
    USAGE: run scripts/basic-hack.js SERVER_NAME
    Example:
        > run scripts/basic-hack.js n00dles

### discover-network.js
